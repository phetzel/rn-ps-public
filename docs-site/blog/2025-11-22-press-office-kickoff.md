Kicking off the public docs with a short update on where the project stands.

<!-- truncate -->

## What’s working

- Core loop (briefing → press → outcomes) is playable across 48 months.
- Situation dataset passed 600 handcrafted entries after the last content push.
- Maestro smoke suite covers the happy path for creating/simming a new run.

## What’s next

- Polish the docs site and share better capture of gameplay.
- Flesh out journalist archetypes so answer tone choices feel sharper.
- Start prepping localized strings for EN→ES once tooling stabilizes.

Thanks for checking out the project—more detailed dev notes coming soon.
