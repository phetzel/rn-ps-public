# Gameplay Guide

Welcome to the Briefing Room. Your job is simple: **Survive the news cycle.**

## The Core Loop

Each level in Press Office represents one month of the administration.

1.  **The Briefing**: You receive a dossier of current situations (crises, policy updates, scandals).
2.  **The Press Conference**: You step onto the podium. Journalists will ask targeted questions about these situations.
3.  **The Response**: You choose how to answer.
    - **Answer**: Give it to them straight. Good for transparency, risky for approval.
    - **Spin**: Twist the narrative. High reward if it works, disaster if you're caught.
    - **Defer**: Dodge the question. Safe, but costs political capital.
4.  **The Outcome**: See how your answers affected the administration's approval ratings and your relationships.

## Scoring & Stats

### Approval Ratings

The lifeblood of the administration. If this drops too low, you're out of a job.

### Political Capital

Your currency. Use it to:

- Defer difficult questions.
- Leak stories to friendly press.
- Bail out failing cabinet members.

### Relationships

- **Journalists**: Friendly journalists give you softballs. Hostile ones dig for dirt.
- **Cabinet Members**: Keep them happy to get better intel on situations.
- **Voter Subgroups**: Different demographics react differently to your spin.
