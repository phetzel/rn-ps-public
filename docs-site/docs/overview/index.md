# Welcome to Press Office

**Press Office** is a React Native simulation game where you play as the White House Press Secretary.

Navigate press conferences, manage relationships with the press corps, and keep the administration's approval ratings afloat through a full four-year term.

## Project Vision

Press Office explores the intersection of simulation gameplay and modern React Native development. It demonstrates a **local-first architecture** using WatermelonDB and a unique **LLM-powered content pipeline** for generating scenarios.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Content**: ~600 situations generated via a custom LLM pipeline, creating deep replayability
- **Relationship System**: Balance favor with journalists, cabinet members, and voter subgroups
- **Offline First**: All game state persists locally — no backend required
- **Production Patterns**: CI/CD, E2E testing, error boundaries, and consent flows
